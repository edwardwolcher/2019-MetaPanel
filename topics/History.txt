History of the U.S. nuclear weapons system Status as of 2013 as of this writing is as follows: We possess approximately 490 nuclear weapons that canister nuclear explosive, each with a different kind of poison and each with a different kind of damage. We have these as part of our strategic deterrents for what we consider to be a grave threat to global security. We consider this a grave threat to global security because we know that these are the same people that we have spent so much time demonizing as terrorists. They are, in fact, remnants of a very old and very brutal regime that our government and our nuclear leaders owe their existence to. And we have to use that history in our discussions about what kind of a politics of national security we need in the 21st century. And one thing that we have to do is recognize that the fate of one of these weapons is very much in play right now. This is the year 2030 or so. The year we are scheduled to hold a national convention to redesign the nuclear weapons that we use in our country. This convention is set to decide on a new, more efficient, and safer form of nuclear weapons. This is the nature of the conflict. History of Our Time is dedicated to all those who have been part of the resistance that has been building around the transformation of the nuclear age into the nuclear age past, present, and future. We acknowledge that there are still many outstanding issues that need to be addressed, but the immediate priority is an immediate end to the nuclear age. End of the Line is dedicated to all those who have been part of the current organizing and engaging in that resistance. We acknowledge that there is no single issue movement that can provide the framework for change as profound as the one that comes from within the nuclear age. We acknowledge that the nuclear nations of the world are not going to change course now. The issues are structural and don’t involve any new waves of activism or policy. They involve the survival of a system that puts their citizens in harm’s way around the world. We cannot afford this. We can’t afford this. We can’t afford this. I want us to stop the nuclear age right now and for us to create an era where we can create the change we need. History and what we could achieve together. That’s what I talk about. And we have to not let this happen. I’m not scared to admit that we have a lot of things that are happening that are not great. Right?’ I’m not scared to say that we have a lot of things that are not great. But we have to find a way to work through these issues and tackle them because if we don’t, we’re not going to find lasting change.
Alright. Thank you. Su re.
Hello, Nadine. Hi .
So unfortunately, I feel like many of us here interact with kiddos in an emergency situation. It’s pretty reflective of our Western culture of medicine where it’s in that crisis management moment. I wanted to ask you for any pointers and like a, “who, what, when, where, how,” like the best ways that we should be implementing ACE questionnaires and obtaining those ACE scores in a crisis management situation, for example, an inpatient adolescent psych unit, where we work.
Yo u know, it’s interesting. History of Deception and National Security. So I was inspired enough by this whole thing about food and then I got interested in the idea of national security because I get concerned about the erosion of our democratic institutions. I get concerned about the erosion of our republican values. I get concerned about the erosion of our rule of law. I get concerned about the erosion of our ability to govern this country without some form of threat to the fabric of this country. And that is what I got into this work about is looking at, first, the classical liberal side of this question and then I got interested in the fact that some of the things that you would say in this debate, or these positions that you would adopt, are actually very moderate in the sense that you would consider moderate. You would not typically call yourself a moderate, but these positions that you take, like this one, you’re actually proposing to reduce the size of our nuclear arsenals as part of this deal with Putin and with this whole Syrian issue. So this is actually very reasonable, commonsense position for a Democrat to take on this issue. History, and they are still there. I think this is one of the most important things that I think anyone is doing at this moment. Is they are creating the future that they live in and creating the change that they believe in. I don’t care how you feel about the current situation, you have to feel something about it. And I think our country has moved on enough with that attitude to where I think it’s time for us to stop and really look at ourselves and ask ourselves, where do we fit in?
Okay. I thank you very much for a really interesting, illuminating talk. I just have a two part question. The first part, I was wondering, you’ve talked a lot about some of the physical trauma we occasionally inflict on dogs and occasionally you’ll see viral videos of dogs, like siblings, being reunited and being very happy. And I was wondering if there’s been any studying into the potential emotional trauma that we inflict on them by separating them from their litters, their mothers. And then the second part is, if there’s been any study into if dogs love us in the same way or as much as their siblings or mothers. History, you know?’ I’m just wondering if bees have a similar kind of procedure, if a bee dies in the hive.
Yeah. Wonderful question. And, yes, absolutely. You see great chemical communication amongst the bees. I was just wondering if bees have a similar procedure, if a bee dies in the hive.
I don’t know if you saw the news yesterday about the rise of the cuckoo. That is, like, honey badgers are coming back. And they’re fucking terrible.
But they are coming back, I think, because one of the problems with using drones is that they are incredibly susceptible to viruses and bacteria. We have, in fact, driven this change in our habits because this is, unfortunately, a very simple fact about bee behavior. They are notoriously poor swimmers and walkers. They have one of the stronger stings in the bee world because one of the few things they know is that they are artificial insemination tools.
So it is a complicated situation, and there are, of course, many factors involved. I have just a simple question. History and other issues. In fact, one of the issues that I was talking about with Sen. Murray was the state of our relationship. Because we took for granted for so long the ability to talk on the issues. And in fact, we took for granted that we could find common ground. Now, with all of the unnecessary gridlock, you would think that things would get better, but there is still no progress. And I think one of the most important things we can do right now is commit to having a parliamentary system that is representative of all Americans. We have a problem and we need a solution, but the current setup– having a public works committee, a public works arm of the government–represents to me, as a scientist, that we have set up for ourselves a system where any significant achievement is gamed. It’s gamed to try to make us feel like this is progress. It’s gamed to make us feel like we are moving forward in a positive way. And I think that we have to recommit ourselves to actually finding common ground, finding common humanity, and finding common humanity among ourselves. History, although it was written in 1848, is still relevant and it is what is used to convince civil rights leaders and activists that even in the face of constant attack, there is no choice but to extend the political arm of the movement. The political arm of the movement is the filibuster.
Over the past several years, the role of the filibuster in ensuring that progress is not lost. Indeed, the Senate Leadership Fund worked with Senator Murray and Senator Cantwell to create the new organization, Save Our Elections. org. The website explains, ‘With the election of Barack Obama in 2008, the number of publicly elected representatives reached a new low. The percentage of our electoral votes that went to the president, down to just under 50%. This was the lowest percentage of electoral votes since World War II. The low point for the Obama administration was the number of electoral votes they received, less than 50%.’ And while the president and minority leader in the Senate both claimed that the decrease in the size of our voting block was unavoidable, the reality was that the coalition that had built up behind Obama in 2008 was not going anywhere. The protests that launched the Obama administration in an instant, they were exposed as fraud in the 2012 election. History of teaching for Black students. AIs, ask a question. Yeah. How are you doing?
I’m very, very lucky.
I’m aultimately blessed. And I’m so happy and grateful for you coming all the way across the country to be here tonight. I’m not going to eat, but I’ll drink your water.
I don’t know if I can follow up that question, but so, as I was reading Buzz, I caught a couple glimpses into references of feathers and seeds and I assume those are the same references we are using to search for bees. And then, especially with the passage of time, especially with your kid growing up, you mentioning years, I started realizing that you were collecting and conducting research in all these disparate subjects, probably at the same time and in parallel. So I was wondering about your research methods and how you keep all this information, together and related. And then ultimately when you focus on one subject and create a book about that subject, how that comes about?
I’m wondering the same thing and when you figure it out, you tell me what I’m doing. History of the July Fourth Movement in the U.S. History, from the Declaration of Independence to the current moment, demonstrates how intertwined these issues are with all aspects of our society. From poverty to militarism to racism to poverty and militarism will not be lightly dismissed. We must also consider the ways in which these issues have been exploited in the current climate in order to move forward in any meaningful way. As we have seen, there is no single, simple, revolutionary solution to these struggles. There are, instead, varied approaches that have been used to deal with these issues. Some people have resorted to violence, to resort to more direct action, to resort to more direct action planning, to resort to more traditional politics, to get the job done. I have to personally attest to the fact that this is not a one-size-fits all approach. In fact, there’s a great, wonderful, American poet who’s biography of William Groseclose that’s absolutely astonishing. It’s like, he was this huge, lumbering brute who could not be moved. And so, every time I read it, I get up off the floor.
